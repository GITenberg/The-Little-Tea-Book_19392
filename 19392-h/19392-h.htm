<p><i>INTRODUCING THE LITTLE TEA BOOK</i></p>

<p>After all, tea is <i>the</i> drink! Domestically and socially it is the
beverage of the world. There may be those who will come forward with <i>their
</i>figures to prove that other fruits of the soil--agriculturally and
commercially--are more important. Perhaps they are right when quoting statistics.
But what other product can compare with tea in the high regard in which it has
always been held by writers whose standing in literature, and recognized good
taste in other walks, cannot be questioned?</p>

<p>A glance through this book will show that the spirit of the tea beverage is
one of peace, comfort, and refinement. As these qualities are all
associated with the ways of women, it is to them, therefore--the real rulers of
the world--that tea owes its prestige and vogue.</p>

<p>Further peeps through these pages prove this to be true; for nearly all the
allusions and references to the beverage, by male writers, reveal the womanly
influence that tea imparts. But this is not all. The side-lights of history,
customs, manners, and modes of living which tea plays in the life of all nations
will be found entertaining and instructive. Linked with the fine feminine
atmosphere which pervades the drinking of the beverage everywhere, a leaf which
can combine so much deserves, at least, a little human hearing for its
long list of virtues; for
its peaceful walks, talks, tales, tattle, frills, and fancies which go to make
up this tribute to "the cup that cheers but not inebriates."</p>


<br>
<p><i>THE ORIGIN OF TEA</i></p>

<p>Darma, third son of Koyuwo, King of India, a religions high priest from Siaka
(the author of that Eastern paganism about a thousand years before the Christian
era), coming to China, to teach the way of happiness, lived a most austere life,
passing his days in continual mortification, and retiring by night to solitudes,
in which he fed only upon the leaves of trees and other vegetable productions.
After several years passed in this manner, in fasting and watching, it happened
that, contrary to his vows, the pious Darma fell asleep! When he awoke, he
was so much enraged at himself, that, to prevent the offence to his vows for the
future, he got rid of his eyelids and placed them on the ground. On the
following day, returning to his accustomed devotions, he beheld, with amazement,
springing up from his eyelids, two small shrubs of an unusual appearance, such
as he had never before seen, and of whose qualities he was, of course, entirely
ignorant. The saint, however, not being wholly devoid of curiosity--or, perhaps,
being unusually hungry--was prompted to eat of the leaves, and immediately felt
within him a wonderful elevation of mind, and a vehement desire of divine
contemplation, with which he acquainted his
disciples, who were eager to follow the example of their instructor, and they
readily received into common use the fragrant plant which has been the theme of
so many poetical and literary pens in succeeding ages.</p>

<p>From what enchanted Eden came thy leaves<br>

That hide such subtle spirits of perfume?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Did eyes preadamite first see the bloom,<br>
Luscious nepenthe of the soul that grieves?</p>

<p>By thee the tired and torpid mind conceives<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Fairer than roses brightening life's gloom,<br>

Thy protean charm can every form assume<br>
And turn December nights to April eves.</p>

<p>Thy amber-tinted drops bring back to me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Fantastic shapes of great Mongolian towers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Emblazoned banners, and the booming gong;<br>
I hear the sound of feast and revelry,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And smell, far sweeter than the sweetest flowers,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The kiosks of Pekin, fragrant of Oolong!

<p><i>LITTLE CUPS OF CHINESE AND JAPANESE TEA</i></p>

<p>Although the legend credits the pious East Indian with the discovery of tea,
there is no evidence extant that India is really the birthplace of the plant.</p>

<p>Since India has no record of date, or facts, on stone or tablet, or ever
handed down a single incident of song or story--apart from the legend--as to the
origin of tea, one is loath to accept the claim--if claim they assert--of a people
who are not above practising the "black art" at every turn of their fancy.</p>

<p>Certain it is that China, first in many things, knew tea as soon as any nation
of the world. The early Chinese were not only more progressive
than other peoples, but linked with their progress were important researches,
and invaluable discoveries, which the civilized world has long ago recognized.
Then, why not add tea to the list?</p>

<p>At any rate, it is easy to believe that the Chinese were first in the tea
fields, and that undoubtedly the plant was a native of both China and Japan when
it was slumbering on the slopes of India, unpicked, unsteeped, undrunk, unhonored, and unsung.</p>

<p>A celebrated Buddhist, St. Dengyo Daishai, is credited with having introduced
tea into Japan from China as early as the fourth century. It is likely that he
was the first to teach the Japanese the use of the herb, for it had long
been a favorite beverage in the mountains of the Celestial
Kingdom. The plant, however, is found in so many parts of Japan that there can
be little doubt but what it is indigenous there as well.</p>

<p>The word TEA is of Chinese origin, being derived from the Amoy and Swatow
reading, "Tay," of the same character, which expresses both the ancient name of
tea, "T'su," and the more modern one, "Cha." Japanese tea, "Chiya"--pronounced Châ.</p>

<p>Tea was not known in China before the Tang dynasty, 618-906 A.D. An infusion
of some kind of leaf, however, was used as early as the Chow dynasty, 1122-255
B.C., as we learn from the Urh-ya, a glossary of terms used in ancient history
and poetry. This work, which is classified by subjects, has been assigned as the
beginning of the Chow dynasty, but belongs more properly to the era of
Confucius, K'ung Kai, 551-479 B.C.</p>

<p>Although known in Japan for more than a thousand years, tea only gradually
became the national beverage as late as the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>In the first half of the eighth century, 729 A.D., there was a record made of
a religious festival, at which the forty-fifth Mikado---"Sublime Gate"--Shommei
Tenno, entertained the Buddhist priests with tea, a hitherto unknown beverage
from Corea, which country was for many years the high-road of Chinese culture to
Japan.</p>

<p>After the ninth century, 823 A.D., and for four centuries thereafter, tea fell into disuse, and almost oblivion,
among the Japanese. The nobility, and Buddhist priests, however, continued to
drink it as a luxury.</p>

<p>During the reign of the eighty-third Emperor, 1199-1210 A.D., the cultivation
of tea was permanently established in Japan. In 1200, the bonze, Yei-Sei,
brought tea seeds from China, which he planted on the mountains in one of the
most northern provinces. Yei-Sei is also credited with introducing the Chinese
custom of ceremonious tea-drinking. At any rate, he presented tea seeds to
Mei-ki, the abbot of the monastery of To-gano (to whom the use of tea had been
recommended for its stimulating properties), and instructed him in the mystery
of its cultivation, treatment, and preparation. Mei-ki, who laid out plantations
near Uzi, was successful as a pupil, and even now the tea-growers of that
neighborhood pay tribute to his memory by annually offering at his shrine the
first gathered tea-leaves.</p>

<p>After that period, the use of tea became more and more in fashion, the monks
and their kindred having discovered its property of keeping them awake during
long vigils and nocturnal prayers.</p>

<p>Prom this time on the development and progress of the plant are interwoven
with the histories and customs of these countries.</p>

<br>

<blockquote>
<p><i>ON TEA</i></p>

<p>The following short poem by Edmund Waller<br>
is believed to be the first one written in praise of<br>
the "cup that does not inebriate":</p>

<p>Venus her myrtle, Phoebus has her bays;<br>
Tea both excels, which she vouchsafes to praise.<br>
The best of Queens, and best of herbs, we owe<br>
To that bold nation, which the way did show<br>
To the fair region where the sun doth rise,<br>
Whose rich productions we so justly prize.<br>
The Muse's friend, tea does our fancy aid,<br>
Repress those vapors which the head invade,<br>
And keep the palace of the soul serene,<br>
Tit on her birthday to salute the Queen.</p>

<p>Waller was born in 1605, and died in 1687, aged<br>
eighty-two.</p>
</blockquote>

<br>

<p><i>SOME ENGLISH TEA HISTORY</i></p>

<p>Tea was brought into Europe by the DUTCH EAST INDIA COMPANY, in 1610. It was
at least forty, and perhaps forty-seven, years later that England woke up to the
fascinations of the new drink. Dr. Johnson puts it at even a later date, for he
claims that tea was first introduced into England by Lords Arlington and Ossory,
in 1666, and really made its debut into society when the wives of these noblemen
gave it its vogue.</p>

<p>If Dr. Johnson's statement is intended to mean that nothing is anything until
the red seal of the select says, "Thus shall it be," he is right in the year he has selected. If, on
the other hand, the Doctor had in mind society at large, he is "mixed in his
dates," or leaves, for tea was drawn and drunk in London nine years before that
date.</p>

<p>Garway, the founder of Garraway's coffee house, claimed the honor of being
first to offer tea in leaf and drink for public sale, in 1657. It is pretty safe
to fix the entrance of tea into Europe even a few years ahead of his
announcement, for merchants in those days did not advertise their wares in
advance.</p>

<p>However, this date is about the beginning of TEA TIME, for in the <i>
Mercurius Politicius</i> of September, 1658, appeared the following
advertisement:</p>

<blockquote>That excellent and by all Physitians approved China drink, called by the
Chineans, Tcha, by other nations, Tay, or Tea, is sold at the Sultana's Head, a
Copphee House, in Sweetings Rents, by the Royal Exchange, London.</blockquote>

<p>Like all new things, when they have fastened on to the public's favor, tea
was on everybody's lips and in everybody's mouth. It was lauded to the skies,
and was supposed to be good for all the ills of the flesh. It would cure colds
and consumption, clear the sight, remove lassitude, purify the liver, improve
digestion, create appetite, strengthen the memory, and cure fever and ague.</p>

<p>One panegyrist says, while never putting the patient in mind of his disease,
it cheers the heart, without disordering the head; strengthens the feet of the
old, and settles the heads of the young; cools the brain of the hard drinker,
and warms that of the sober student; relieves the sick, and makes the healthy
better. Epicures drink it for want of an appetite; <i>bon
vivants</i>, to remove the effects of a surfeit of wine; gluttons, as a remedy
for indigestion; politicians, for the vertigo; doctors, for drowsiness;
prudes, for the vapors; wits, for the spleen; and beaux to improve their
complexions; summing up, by declaring tea to be a treat for the frugal, a
regale for the luxurious, a successful agent for the man of business, and a
bracer for the idle.</p>

<p>Poets and verse-makers joined the chorus in praise of tea, in Greek and
Latin. One poet pictures Hebe pouring the delightful cup for the goddesses, who,
finding it made their beauty brighter and their wit more brilliant, drank
so deeply as to disgust Jupiter, who had forgotten that he,
himself,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Drank tea that happy morn,<br>
When wise Minerva of his brain was born."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Laureant Tate, who wrote a poem on tea in two cantos, described a family jar
among the fair deities, because each desired to become the special patroness of
the ethereal drink destined to triumph over wine. Another versifier exalts it at
the expense of its would-be rival, coffee:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"In vain would coffee boast an equal good,<br>
The crystal stream transcends the flowing mud,<br>
 Tea, even the ills from coffee spring repairs,<br>
Disclaims its vices and its virtues shares."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another despairing enthusiast exclaims:</p>

<blockquote>
<p> "Hail, goddess of the vegetable, hail!<br>
To sing thy worth, all words, all numbers, fail!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The new beverage did not have the field all to itself, however, for, while it
was generally admitted that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tea was fixed, and come to stay.<br>
It could not drive good meat and drink away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lovers of the old and conservative customs of the table were not anxious to
try the novelty. Others shied at it; some flirted with it, in tiny teaspoonfuls;
others openly defied and attacked it. Among the latter were a number of robust
versifiers and physicians.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"'Twas better for each British virgin,<br>
When on roast beef, strong beer and sturgeon,<br>
Joyous to breakfast they sat round,<br>
Nor were ashamed to eat a pound."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fleshly school of doctors were only too happy to disagree with their
brethren respecting the merits and demerits of the new-fangled drink; and
it is hard to say which were most bitter, the friends or the foes of tea.</p>

<p>Maria Theresa's physician, Count Belchigen, attributed the discovery of a number
of new diseases to the debility born of daily tea-drinking. Dr. Paulli denied
that it had either taste or fragrance, owing its reputation entirely to the
peculiar vessels and water used by the Chinese, so that it was folly to partake
of it, unless tea-drinkers could supply themselves with pure water from the
Vassie and the fragrant tea-pots of Gnihing. This sagacious sophist and
dogmatizer also discovered that, among other evils, tea-drinking deprived its
devotees of the power of expectoration, and entailed sterility; wherefore he
hoped Europeans would thereafter keep to their natural beverages--wine and
ale--and reject coffee, chocolate, and tea, which were all
equally bad for them.</p>

<p>In spite of the array of old-fashioned doctors, wits, and lovers of the pipe
and bottle, who opposed evil effects, sneered at the finely bred men of England
being turned into women, and grumbled at the stingy custom of calling for
dish-water after dinner, the custom of tea-drinking continued to grow. By 1689
the sale of the leaf had increased sufficiently to make it politic to reduce the
duty on it from eight pence on the decoction to five shillings a pound on the
leaf. The value of tea at this time may be estimated from a customhouse report
of the sale of a quantity of divers sorts and qualities, the worst being equal
to that "used in coffee-houses for making single tea," which, being disposed of by "inch of
candle," fetched an average of twelve shillings a pound.</p>

<p>During the next three years the consumption of tea was greatly increased;
but very little seems to have been known about it by those who drank it--if we
may judge from the enlightenment received from a pamphlet, given gratis, "up one
flight of stairs, at the sign of the Anodyne Necklace, without Temple Bar." All
it tells us about tea is that it is the leaf of a little shoot growing
plentifully in the East Indies; that Bohea--called by the French "Bean Tea"--is
best of a morning with bread and butter, being of a more nourishing nature than
the green which may be used when a meal is not wanted. Three or four cups
at a sitting are enough; and a little milk or cream
renders the beverage smoother and more powerful in blunting the acid humors of
the stomach.</p>

<p>The satirists believed that tea had a contrary effect upon the acid humors of
the mind, making the tea-table the arena for the display of the feminine
capacity for backbiting and scandal. Listen to Swift describe a lady enjoying
her evening cups of tea:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Surrounded with the noisy clans<br>
Of prudes, coquettes and harridans.<br>
Now voices over voices rise,<br>
While each to be the loudest vies;<br>
They contradict, affirm, dispute,<br>
No single tongue one moment mute;<br>
All mad to speak, and none to hearken,<br>
They set the very lapdog barking;<br>
Their chattering makes a louder din<br>
Than fish-wives o'er a cup of gin;<br>
Far less the rabble roar and rail<br>
When drunk with sour election ale."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even gentle Gay associated soft tea with the temper of women when he pictures
Doris and Melanthe abusing all their bosom friends, while--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Through all the room<br>
From flowery tea exhales a fragrant fume."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But not all the women were tea-drinkers in those days. There was Madam Drake,
the proprietress of one of the three private carriages Manchester could boast.
Few men were as courageous as she in declaring against the tea-table when they
were but invited guests. Madam Drake did not hesitate to make it known when she
paid an afternoon's visit that she expected to be offered her customary solace--a
tankard of ale and a pipe of tobacco.</p>

<p>Another female opponent of tea was the <i>Female Spectator</i>, which declared the use of the fluid to be
not only expensive, but pernicious; the utter destruction of all economy, the
bane of good housewifery, and the source of all idleness. Tradesmen especially
suffered from the habit. They could not serve their customers because their
apprentices were absent during the busiest hours of the day drumming up gossips
for their mistresses' tea-tables.</p>

<p>This same censor says that the most temperate find themselves obliged to
drink wine freely after tea, or supplement their Bohea with rum and brandy, the
bottle and glass becoming as necessary to the tea-table as the slop-basin.</p>

<p>Although Jonas Hanway, the father of the umbrella, was successful in
keeping off water, he was not successful in keeping out tea. All he
did accomplish in his essay on the subject was to call forth a reply from Dr.
Johnson, who, strange to say, instead of vigorously defending his favorite
tipple, rather excuses it as an amiable weakness; confessing that tea is a
barren superfluity, fit only to amuse the idle, relax the studious, and dilute
the meals of those who cannot take exercise, and will not practise abstinence.
His chief argument in tea's favor is that it is drunk in no great quantity even
by those who use it most, and as it neither exhilarates the heart nor stimulates
the palate, is, after all, but a nominal entertainment, serving as a pretence
for assembling people together, for interrupting business, diversifying
idleness; admitting that, perhaps, while gratifying the taste,
without nourishing the body, it is quite unsuited to the lower classes.</p>

<p>It is a singular fact, too, that at that period there was no other really
vigorous defender of the beverage. All the best of the other writers did was to
praise its pleasing qualities, associations, and social attributes.</p>

<p>Still, tea grew in popular favor, privately and publicly. The custom had now
become so general that every wife looked upon the tea-pot, cups, and caddy to be
as much her right by marriage as the wedding-ring itself. Fine ladies enjoyed
the crowded public entertainments with tea below stairs and ventilators above.
Citizens, fortunate enough to have leaden roofs to their houses, took their tea
and their ease thereon. On Sundays, finding the country lanes leading to
Kensington, Hampstead, Highgate, Islington, and Stepney, "to be much pleasanter
than the paths of the gospel," the people flocked to those suburban resorts with
their wives and children, to take tea under the trees. In one of Coleman's
plays, a Spitalfield's dame defines the acme of elegance as:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Drinking tea on summer afternoons<br>
At Bagnigge Wells with china and gilt spoons."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>London was surrounded with tea-gardens, the most popular being Sadlier's
Wells, Merlin's Cave, Cromwell Gardens, Jenny's Whim, Cuper Gardens, London Spa,
and the White Conduit House, where they used to take in fifty pounds on a Sunday
afternoon for sixpenny tea-tickets.</p>

<p>One D'Archenholz was surprised by the elegance, beauty, and luxury of these
resorts, where, Steele said, they swallowed gallons of the juice of tea, while
their own dock leaves were trodden under foot.</p>

<p>The ending of the East India Company's monopoly of the trade, coupled with
the fact that the legislature recognized that tea had passed out of the
catalogue of luxuries into that of necessities, began a new era for the queen of
drinks destined to reign over all other beverages.</p>

<p><i>TEA LEAVES</i></p>

<p>BY JOHN ERNEST MCCANN</p>

<p>According to Henry Thomas Buckle, the author of "The History of
Civilization in England," who was the master of eighteen languages, and had a
library of 22,000 volumes, with an income of $75,000 a year, at the age of
twenty-nine, in 1850 (he died in 1860, at the age of thirty-nine), tea making
and drinking were, or are, what Wendell Phillips would call lost arts. He
thought that, when it came to brewing tea, the Chinese philosophers were not
living in his vicinity. He distinctly wrote that, until he showed her how,
no woman of his acquaintance could make a decent cup
of tea. He insisted upon a warm cup, and even spoon, and saucer. Not that Mr.
Buckle ever sipped tea from a saucer. Of course, he was right in insisting upon
those above-mentioned things, for tea-things, like a tea-party, should be in
sympathy with the tea, not antagonistic to it. Still, not always; for, on one
memorable occasion, in the little town of Boston, the greatest tea-party in
history was anything but sympathetic. But let that pass.</p>

<p>Emperor Kien Lung wrote, 200 years or more ago, for the benefit of his
children, just before he left the Flowery Kingdom for a flowerier:</p>

<p>"Set a tea-pot over a slow fire; fill it with cold water; boil it
long enough to turn a lobster red; pour it on the quantity of tea in a porcelain
vessel; allow it to remain on the leaves until the vapor evaporates, then sip it
slowly, and all your sorrows will follow the vapor."</p>

<p>He says nothing about milk or sugar. But, to me, tea without sugar is poison,
as it is with milk. I can drink one cup of tea, or coffee, with sugar, but
without milk, and feel no ill effects; but if I put milk in either tea or
coffee, I am as sick as a defeated candidate for the Presidency. That little bit
of fact is written as a hint to many who are ill without knowing why they are,
after drinking tea, or coffee, with milk in it. I don't think that milk was ever
intended for coffee or tea. Why should it be? Who was the first to color
tea and coffee with milk? It may have been a mad prince, in
the presence of his flatterers and imitators, to be odd; or just to see if his
flatterers would adopt the act.</p>

<p>The Russians sometimes put champagne in their tea; the Germans, beer; the
Irish, whiskey; the New Yorker, ice cream; the English, oysters, or clams, if
in season; the true Bostonian, rose leaves; and the Italian and Spaniard,
onions and garlic.</p>

<p>You all know one of the following lines, imperfectly. Scarcely one in one
hundred quotes them correctly. <i>I</i> never have quoted them as written, off-hand--but
lines run out of my head like schoolboys out of school,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"When the lessons and tasks are all ended,<br>
And school for the day is dismissed."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Here are the lines:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Now stir the fire, and close the shutters fast;<br>
Let fall the curtains; wheel the sofa round;<br>
And while the bubbling and loud-hissing urn<br>
Throws up a steamly column, and the cups<br>
That cheer, but not inebriate, wait on each,<br>
To let us welcome peaceful evening in."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Isn't that a picture? Not one superfluous word in it! Who knows its author,
or when it was written, or can quote the line before or after</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "the cups<br>
That cheer, but not inebriate"?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or in what poem the lines run down the ages? I tell you? Not I. I don't
believe in encouraging laziness. If I tell you, you will let it slip from your
memory, like a panic-stricken eel through the fingers of a panic-stricken
schoolboy; but if you hunt it up, it will be riveted to your memory, like a
ballet, and one never forgets when, where, how, why, and from whom, he receives that.</p>

<p>What a pity that, in Shakespeare's time, there was no tea-table! What a
delightful comedy he could, and would, have written around it, placing the scene
in his native Stratford! What a charming hostess at a tea-table his mother, Mary
Arden (loveliest of womanly names), would have made! Any of the ladies of the
delightful "Cranford" wouldn't be a circumstance to a tea-table scene in a
Warwickshire comedy, with lovely Mary Arden Shakespeare as the protagonist, if
the comedy were from the pen of her delightful boy, Will. Had tea been known in
Shakespeare's time, how much more closely he would have brought his sexes, under
one roof, instead of sending the more animal of the two off to The Boar's
Head and The Mermaid, leaving the ladies
to their own verbal devices.</p>

<p>Shakespeare, being such a delicate, as well as virile, poet, would have taken
to tea as naturally as a bee takes to a rose or honeysuckle; for the very word
"tea" suggests all that is fragrant, and clean, and spotless: linen,
silver, china, toast, butter, a charming room with charming women, charmingly
gowned, and peach and plum and apple trees, with the scent of roses, just beyond
the open, half-curtained windows, looking down upon, or over, orchard or garden,
as the May or June morning breezes suggest eternal youth, as they fill the room
with perfume, tenderness, love, optimism, and hope in immortality. Coffee
suggests taverns, cafés, sailing vessels, yachts, boarding-houses-by-the-river-side,
and pessimism. Tea suggests optimism. Coffee is a tonic; tea, a
comfort. Coffee is prose; tea is poetry. Whoever thinks of taking coffee into a
sick-room? Who doesn't think of taking in the comforting cup of tea? Can the
most vivid imagination picture the angels (above the stars) drinking coffee? No.
Yet, if I were to show them to you over the teacups, you would not be surprised
or shocked. Would you? Not a bit of it. You would say:</p>

<p>"That's a very pretty picture. Pray, what are they talking about, or of whom
are they talking?"</p>

<p>Why, of their loved ones below, and of the days of their coming above the
stars. They know when to look for us, and while the time may seem long to
us before the celestial reunion, to them it is short. They do not worry, as we
do. We could not match their beautiful serenity if we tried, for they know the
folly of wishing to break or change divine laws.</p>

<p>What delightful scandals have been born at tea-tables--rose and lavender, and
old point lace scandals: surely, no brutal scandals or treasons, as in the
tavern. Tea-table gossip surely never seriously hurt a reputation. Well, name
one. No? Well, think of the shattered reputations that have fallen around the
bottle. Men are the worst gossips unhanged, not women.</p>

<p>In 1652, tea sold for as high as £10 in the leaf. Pepys had his first cup of
tea in September, 1660. (See his Diary.) The rare recipe for making tea in those
days was known only to the elect, and here it is:</p>

<p>"To a pint of tea, add the yolks of two fresh eggs; then beat them up with as
much fine sugar as is sufficient to sweeten the tea, and stir well together. The
water must remain no longer upon the tea than while you can chant the Miserere
psalm in a leisurely fashion."</p>

<p>But I am not indorsing recipes of 250 odd years ago. The above is from the
knowledge box of a Chinese priest, or a priest from China, called Père Couplet
(don't print it Quatrain), in 1667. He gave it to the Earl of Clarendon, and I
extend it to you, if you wish to try it.</p>

<p>John Milton knew the delights of tea. He drank coffee during the composition
of "Paradise Lost," and tea during the building of "Paradise Regained."</p>

<p>Like all good things, animate and inanimate, tea did not become popular
without a struggle. It, like the gradual oak, met with many kinds of opposition,
from the timid, the prejudiced, and the selfish. All sorts of herbs were put
upon the market to offset its popularity; such as onions, sage, marjoram, the
Arctic bramble, the sloe, goat-weed, Mexican goosefoot, speedwell, wild
geranium, veronica, wormwood, juniper, saffron, carduus benedictus, trefoil,
wood-sorrel, pepper, mace, scurry grass, plantain, and betony.</p>

<p>Sir Hans Sloane invented herb tea, and Captain Cook's companion, Dr. Solander, invented another tea, but it was
no use--tea had come to stay, and a blessing it has been to the world, when
moderately used. You don't want to become a tea drunkard, like Dr. Johnson, nor
a coffee fiend, like Balzac. Be moderate in all things, and you are bound to be
happy and live long. Moderation in eating, drinking, loving, hating, smoking,
talking, acting, fighting, sleeping, walking, lending, borrowing, reading
newspapers--in expressing opinions--even in bathing and praying--means long life
and happiness.</p>

<p>Books upon books have been published in relation to the evil effects of
tea-drinking, but, for
all that, no statistics are at hand to show that their arguments have made
teetotalers of tea-drinkers. One of the best things, however, said against
tea-drinking is distinctly in its favor to a certain extent. It is from one Dr.
Paulli, who laments that "tea so dries the bodies of the Chinese that they can
hardly spit." This will find few sympathizers among us. We suggest the quotation
to some enterprising tea-dealer to be used in a street-car advertisement.</p>

<p>Of all methods of making tea, that hit upon by Heine's Italian landlord was
perhaps the most economical. Heine lodged in a house at Lucca, the first floor
of which was occupied by an English family. The latter complained of the cookery
of Italy in general, and their landlord's in particular. Heine declared the
landlord brewed the best tea ho had ever tasted in the country, and to convince
his doubtful English friends, invited them to take tea with him and his brother.
The invitation was accepted. Tea-time came, but no tea. When the poet's patience
was exhausted, his brother went to the kitchen to expedite matters. There he
found his landlord, who, in blissful ignorance of what company the Heines had
invited, cried: "You can get no tea, for the family on the first floor have not
taken tea this evening."</p>

<p>The tea that had delighted Heine was made from the used leaves of the English
party, who found and made their own tea, and thus afforded the landlord an
opportunity of obtaining at once praise and profit by this Italian method of
serving a pot of tea.--<i>Chambers's Journal</i>.</p>

<br>
<p><i>TEA MAKING AND TAKING IN JAPAN AND CHINA</i></p>

<p>The queen of teas in Japan is a fine straw-colored beverage, delicate
and subtle in flavor, and as invigorating as a glass of champagne. It is real
Japan tea, and seldom leaves its native heath for the reason that, while it is
peculiarly adaptable to the Japanese constitution, it is too stimulating for the
finely-tuned and over-sensitive Americans, who, by the way, are said to be the
largest customers for Japan teas of other grades in the world.</p>

<p>This particular tea, which looks as harmless as our own importations of
the leaf, is a very insidious beverage,
as an American lady soon found out after taking some of it late at night. She
declared, after drinking a small cup before retiring, she did not close her eyes
in sleep for a week. We do not know the name of the brand of tea, and are glad
of it; for we live in a section where the women are especially curious.</p>

<p>But the drink of the people at large in Japan is green tea, although powdered
tea is also used, but reserved for special functions and ceremonial occasions.
Tea, over there, is not made by infusing the leaves with boiling water, as is
the case with us; but the boiling water is first carefully cooled in another
vessel to 176 degrees Fahrenheit. The leaves are also renewed for every
infusion. It would be crime against his August Majesty, the Palate, to use the same leaves more than once--in
Japan. The preparation of good tea is regarded by the Japs as the height of
social art, and for that reason it is an important element in the domestic,
diplomatic, political, and general life of the country.</p>

<p>Tea is the beverage--the masterpiece--of every meal, even if it be nothing but
boiled rice. Every artisan and laborer, going to work, carries with him his
rice-box of lacquered wood, a kettle, a tea-caddy, a tea-pot, a cup, and his
chop-sticks. Milk and sugar are generally eschewed. The Japs and the Chinese
never indulge in either of these ingredients in tea; the use of which, they
claim, spoils the delicate aroma.</p>

<p>From the highest court circles down to the lowliest and poorest of the Emperor's subjects, it is the custom
in both Japan and China to offer tea to every visitor upon his arrival. Not to
do this would be an unpardonable breach of national manners. Even in the shops,
the customer is regaled with a soothing cup before the goods are displayed to
him. This does not, however, impose any obligation on the prospective purchaser,
but it is, nevertheless, a good stimulant to part with his money. This appears
to be a very ancient tradition in China and Japan--so ancient that it is
continued by the powers that be in Paradise and Hades, according to a
translation called "Strange Stories from My Small Library," a classical Chinese
work published in 1679.</p>

<p>The old domestic etiquette of Japan never intrusted to a servant the making
of tea for a guest. It was made by the master of the house himself; the custom
probably growing out of the innate politeness and courtesy of a people who
believe that an honored visitor is entitled to the best entertainment possible
to give him.</p>

<p>As soon as a guest is seated upon his mat, a small tray is set before the
master of the house. Upon this tray is a tiny tea-pot with a handle at right
angles to the spout. Other parts of this outfit include a highly artistic
tea-kettle filled with hot water, and a requisite number of small cups, set in
metal or bamboo trays. These trays are used for handing the cups around, but the
guest is not expected to take one. The cups being without handles, and not easy to hold, the
visitor must therefore be careful lest he let one slip through his untutored
fingers.</p>

<p>The tea-pot is drenched with hot water before the tea is put in; then more
hot water is poured over the leaves, and soon poured off into the cups. This is
repeated several times, but the hot water is never allowed to stand on the
grounds over a minute.</p>

<p>The Japanese all adhere to the general household custom of the country in
keeping the necessary tea apparatus in readiness. In the living-room of every
house is contained a brazier with live coals, a kettle to boil water, a tray
with tea-pot, cups, and a tea-caddy.</p>

<p>Their neighbors, the Chinese, are just as alert; for no matter what hour of the day it may be, they always keep
a kettle of boiling water over the hot coals, ready to make and serve the
beverage at a moment's notice. No visitor is allowed to leave without being
offered a cup of their tea, and they themselves are glad to share in their own
hospitality.</p>

<p>The Chinese use boiling water, and pour it upon the dry tea in each cup.
Among the better social element is used a cup shaped like a small bowl, with a
saucer a little less in diameter than the top of the bowl. This saucer also
serves another purpose, and is often used for a cover when the tea is making.
After the boiling water is poured upon the tea, it is covered for a couple of
minutes, until the leaves have separated and fallen to the bottom of the cup. This process renders the tea clear,
delightfully fragrant, and appetizing.</p>

<p>A variety of other cups are also used; the most prominent being without
handles, one or two sizes larger than the Japanese. They are made of the finest
china, set in silver trays beautifully wrought, ornate in treatment and design.</p>

<p>A complete tea outfit is a part of the outfitting of every <i>Ju-bako</i>--
"picnic-box"--with which every Jap is provided when on a journey, making an
excursion, or attending a picnic. The Japanese are very much given to these
out-of-door affairs, which they call <i>Hanami</i>--"Looking at the flowers." No
wonder they are fond of these pleasures, for it is a land of lovely landscapes
and heaven-sent airs, completely in harmony with the poetic and artistic natures of this
splendid people.</p>

<p>Tea-houses--<i>Châ ya</i>--which
take the place of our cafes and bar rooms, but which, nevertheless, serve a far
higher social purpose, are everywhere in evidence, on the high-roads and
by-roads, tucked away in templed groves and public resorts of every nature.</p>

<p>Among the Japanese are a number of ceremonial, social, and literary
tea-parties which reflect their courtly and chivalrous spirit, and keep alive
the traditions of the people more, perhaps, than any other of their functions.</p>

<p>The most important of these tea-parties are exclusively for gentlemen, and
their forms and ceremonies rank among the most refined usages of polite society. The customs of these
gatherings are so peculiarly characteristic of the Japanese that few foreign
observers have an opportunity of attending them. These are the tea-parties of a
semi-literary or aesthetic character, and the ceremonious <i>Châ-no-ya.</i> In
the first prevails the easy and unaffected tone of the well-bred gentleman. In
the other are observed the strictest rules of etiquette both in speech and
behavior. But the former entertainment is by far the most interesting. The
Japanese love and taste for fine scenery is shown in the settings and
surroundings. To this picturesque outlook, recitals of romance and impromptu
poetry add intellectual charm to the tea-party.</p>

<p>For these occasions the host selects a tea-house located in well-laid-out
grounds and commanding a fine view. In this he lays mats equal to the number of
guests. By sliding the partition and removing the front wall the place is
transformed into an open hall overlooking the landscape. The room is filled with
choice flowers, and the art treasures of the host, which at other times are
stored away in the fire-proof vault--"go down"--of his private residence,
contribute artistic beauty and decoration to the scene. Folding screens and
hanging pictures painted by celebrated artists, costly lacquer-ware, bronze,
china, and other heirlooms are tastefully distributed about the room.</p>

<p>Stories told at these tea-parties are called by the Japanese names of <i>
Châ-banashi</i>, meaning tea-stories, or <i>Hiti-Kuchá</i>--"one mouth stories,"
short stories told at one sitting. At times professional story-tellers are
employed. Of these there are two kinds: Story-Tellers and "Cross-Road Tradition
Narrators," both of whom since olden times have been the faithful custodians and
disseminators of native folk-lore and tales.</p>

<p>These professionals are divided into a number of classes, the most important
being the <i>Hanashi-Ka</i>, members of a celebrated company under a well-known
manager, who unites them into troops of never less than five or more than seven
in number. Such companies are often advertised weeks before their arrival in a
place by hoisting flags or streamers with the names of the performers thereon.
Their programme consists of war-stories, traditions, and recitals
with musical accompaniment. During the intermission, feats of legerdemain or
wrestling fill in the time and give variety to the entertainment.</p>

<p>These are the leading professional performers. The other classes, while not
held in as high regard by the select, nevertheless have a definite place in
Japanese amusement circles. One of the latter is the <i>Tsuji-kô-shâku-ji.</i>
This word-swallower does not belong to any company, but is a "free-lance"
entertainer. A sort of "has been," he does not, however, rest on his past
laurels, but continues to perform whenever he can obtain an audience--on the
highways, to passers-by, in public resorts and thoroughfares.</p>

<p>Although the Chinese are not so neat in their public habits as the Japs,
still their tea-houses and similar resorts are just as numerous and popular as
they are in the neighboring country. Perhaps the most interesting caterers in
China, however, are the coolies, who sell hot water in the rural districts.
These itinerants have an ingenious way of announcing their coming by a whistling
kettle. This vessel contains a compartment for fire with a funnel going through
the top. A coin with a hole is placed so that when the water is boiling a
regular steam-whistle is heard.</p>

<p>Plentiful as tea is in China, however, the poor people there do not consume
as good a quality of the leaf as the same class in our own country.</p>
<p>Especially is this the case in the northern part of China, where most of the
inhabitants just live, and that is all. There they are obliged to use the last
pickings of tea, commonly known as "brick tea," which is very poor and coarse in
quality. It is pressed into bricks about eight by twelve inches in size, and
whenever a quantity of it is needed a piece is knocked off and pulverized in a
kettle of boiling water. Other ingredients, consisting of suit, milk, butter, a
little pepper, and vinegar, are added, and this combination constitutes the
entire meal of the family.</p>

<p>Tea in China and Japan is the stand-by of every meal--the never-failing and
ever-ready refreshment. Besides being the courteous offering to the visitor, it
serves a high purpose in the home life of these peoples; uniting the family and friends in
their domestic life and pleasures at all times and seasons. At home round the
brazier and the lamp in winter evenings, at picnic parties and excursions to the
shady glen during the fine season, tea is the social connecting medium, the
intellectual stimulant and the universal drink of these far-and-away peoples.</p>

<br>
<p><i>TEA-DRINKING IN OTHER LANDS</i></p>


<p>While tea-drinking outside of Japan and China is not attended with any
"high-days and holidays," still there are countries where it is just as
important element of the daily life of its people as it is in the Land of the
Rising Sun.</p>

<p>Among the Burmese a newly-married couple, to insure a happy life, exchange a
mixture of tea-leaves steeped in oil.</p>

<p>In Bokhara, every man carries a small bag of tea about with him. When he is
thirsty he hands a certain quantity over to the booth-keeper, who makes the
beverage for him. The Bokhariot, who is a confirmed tea-slave,
finds it just as hard to pass a tea-booth without indulging in the herb as our
own inebriates do to go by a corner cafe. His breakfast beverage is <i>Schitschaj</i>
--tea in which bread is soaked and flavored with milk, cream, or
mutton fat. During the daytime he drinks green tea with cakes of flour and
mutton suet. It is considered a gross breach of manners to cool the hot tea by
blowing the breath. This is overcome by supporting the right elbow in the left
hand and giving an easy, graceful, circular movement to the cup. The time it
takes for each kind of tea to draw is calculated to a second. When the can is
emptied it is passed around among the company for each tea-drinker
to take up as many leaves as can be held between the thumb and
finger; the leaves being considered a special dainty.</p>

<p>An English traveller once journeying through Asiatic Russia was obliged to
claim the hospitality of a family of Buratsky Arabs. At mealtime the mistress of
the tent placed a large kettle on the fire, wiped it carefully with a horse's
tail, filled it with water, threw in some coarse tea and a little salt. When
this was nearly boiled she stirred the mixture with a brass ladle until the
liquor became very brown, when she poured it into another vessel. Cleaning the
kettle as before, the woman set it again on the fire to fry a paste of meal and
fresh butter. Upon this she poured the tea and some thick cream,
stirred it, and after a time the whole. Was taken off the fire and set aside to cool.
Half-pint mugs were handed around and the tea ladled into them: the result, a
pasty tea forming meat and drink, satisfying both hunger and thirst.</p>

<p>M. Vámbéry says: "The picture of a newly encamped caravan in the summer
months, on the steppes of Central Asia, is a truly interesting one. While the
camels in the distance, but still in sight, graze greedily, or crush the juicy
thistles, the travellers, even to the poorest among them, sit with their
tea-cups in their hands and eagerly sip the costly beverage. It is nothing more
than a greenish warm water, innocent of sugar, and often decidedly turbid;
still, human art has discovered no food, invented no nectar,
which is so grateful, so refreshing, in the desert
as this unpretending drink. I have still a vivid recollection of its wonderful
effects. As I sipped the first drops, a soft fire filled my veins, a fire which
enlivened without intoxicating. The later draughts affected both heart and head;
the eye became peculiarly bright and began to glow. In such moments I felt an
indescribable rapture and sense of comfort. My companions sunk in sleep; I could
keep myself awake and dream with open eyes!"</p>

<p>Tea is the national drink of Russia, and as indispensable an ingredient of
the table there as bread or meat. It is taken at all hours of the day and night,
and in all the griefs of the Russian he flies to tea and vodka for mental
refuge and consolation. Tea is drunk out of tumblers in Russia. In the
homes of the wealthy these tumblers are held in silver holders like the sockets
that hold our soda-water glasses. These holders are decorated, of course, with
the Russian idea of art.</p>

<p>In every Russian town tea-houses flourish. In these public resorts a large
glass of tea with plenty of sugar in it is served at what would cost, in our
money, about two cents. Tea with lemon is so general that milk with the drink,
over there, is considered a fad.</p>

<p>The Russians seem to like beverages that bite--set the teeth on edge, as it
were.</p>

<p>The poor in Russia take a lump of sugar in their mouths and let
the tea trickle through it. Travelling tea-peddlers, equipped with kettles
wrapped up in towels to preserve the heat, and a row of glasses in leather
pockets, furnish a glass of hot tea at any hour of the day or night.</p>

<p>The Russian samovar--from the Greek "to boil itself"--is a graceful dome-topped
brass urn with a cylinder two or three inches in diameter passing through it
from top to bottom. The cylinder is filled with live coals, and keeps the water
boiling hot. The Russian tea-pots are porcelain or earthen. Hot water to heat
the pot is first put in and then poured out; dry tea is then put in, boiling
water poured over it; after which the pot is placed on top of the samovar.</p>

<p>We all know about tea-drinking in England. It is not a very picturesque
or interesting occasion, at best. To the traditional Englishman's mind
it means simply a quiet evening at home, attended by the papers, and serious
conversations in which the head of the house deals out political and domestic
wisdom until ten o'clock. During the day, tea-taking begins with breakfast and
rounds up on the fashionable thoroughfares in the afternoon. Here one may see
the Britishers at their best and worst. These places are called "tea-shops,"
and in them one may acquire the latest hand-shake, the freshest tea and gossip,
see the newest modes and millinery, meet and greet the whirl of the world. An
interesting study of types, in contrasts and conditions of society, worth the
price of a whole chest of choice tea. </p>

<p>We are pretty prosaic tea-drinkers in America. Is it because there is not
enough "touch and go" about the drink, or that we are too busy to settle down to
the quiet, comfort, and thoughtful tea-ways of our contemporaries? Wait
until a few things are settled; when our kitchen queens do not leave us in the
"gray of the morning," and all of our daughters have obtained diplomas in the
art and science of gastronomy.</p>

<p>However made or taken, tea at best or worst is a glorious drink. As a
stimulant for the tired traveller and weary worker it is unique in its restful,
retiring, soothing, and caressing qualities.</p>

Of knightly troubadour or gay trouvère,<br>
Yet deem not thou, an alien quite to numbers,<br>
That friend to prattle and that foe to slumbers,<br>
Which Kian-Long, imperial poet, praised<br>
So high that, cent per cent, its price was raised;<br>
Which Pope himself would sometimes condescend<br>
To place commodious at a couplet's end;<br>
Which the sweet Bard of Olney did not spurn,<br>
Who loved the music of the "hissing urn."<br>
. . . <br>
For the dear comforts of domestic tea<br>
Are sung too well to stand in need of me<br>
By Cowper and the Bard of Rimini;<br>
Besides, I hold it as a special grace<br>
When such a theme is old and commonplace.<br>
The cheering lustre of the new-stirr'd fire,<br>
The mother's summons to the dozing sire,<br>
The whispers audible that oft intrude<br>
On the forced silence of the younger brood,<br>
The seniors' converse, seldom over new,<br>
Where quiet dwells and strange events are few,<br>
The blooming daughter's ever-ready smile,<br>
So full of meaning and so void of guile.<br>
And all the little mighty things that cheer<br>
The closing day from quiet year to year,<br>
I leave to those whom benignant fate<br>
Or merit destines to the wedded state.<br>
. . . <br>
'Tis woman still that makes or mars the man.<br>
And so it is, the creature can beguile<br>
The fairest faces of the readiest smile.<br>
The third who comes the hyson to inhale,<br>
If not a man, at least appears a male.<br>
. . . <br>
Last of the rout, and dogg'd with public cares,<br>
The politician stumbles up the stairs;<br>
Whose dusky soul nor beauty can illume,<br>
Nor wine dispel his patriotic gloom.<br>
In restless ire from guest to guest he goes,<br>
And names us all among our country's foes;<br>
Swears 'tis a shame that we should drink our tea,<br>
'Till wrongs are righted and the nation free,<br>
That priests and poets are a venal race,<br>
Who preach for patronage and rhyme for place;<br>
Declares that boys and girls should not be cooing.<br>
When England's hope is bankruptcy and ruin;<br>
That wiser 'twere the coming wrath to fly,<br>
And that old women should make haste to die.</p>

<p><i>LADIES, LITERATURE, AND TEA</i></p>

<p>In spite of the fact that coffee is just as important a beverage as tea, tea
has been sipped more in literature.</p>

<p>Tea is certainly as much of a social drink as coffee, and more of a domestic,
for the reason that the teacup hours are the family hours. As these are the
hours when the sexes are thrown together, and as most of the poetry and
philosophy of tea-drinking teem with female virtues, vanities, and
whimsicalities, the inference is that, without women, tea would be nothing, and
without tea, women would be stale, flat, and uninteresting. With them it is a polite, purring, soft, gentle, kind,
sympathetic, delicious beverage.</p>

<p>In support of this theory, notice what Pope, Gay, Crabbe, Cowper, Dryden, and
others have written on the subject.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The tea-cup times of hood and hoop,<br>
And when the patch was worn"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>--wrote Tennyson of the early half of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>What a suggestive couplet, full of the foibles and follies of the times! A
picture a la mode of the period when fair dames made their red cheeks cute with
eccentric patches. Ornamented with high coiffures, powdered hair, robed in satin
petticoats and square-cut bodices, they blossomed, according to the old
engravings, into most fetching figures. Even the beaux of the day affected feminine frills in their many-colored,
bell-skirted waistcoats, lace ruffles, patches, and powdered queues.</p>

<p>Dryden must have succumbed to the charms of women through tea, when he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"And thou, great Anna, whom three realms obey,<br>
Dost sometimes take counsel, and sometimes tay."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the great vogue which tea started grew a taste for china; the more
peculiar and striking the design, the more valuable the tea-set.</p>

<p>Pope in one of his satirical compositions praises the composure of a woman
who is</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Mistress of herself though china fall."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even that fine old bachelor, philosopher, and humorist, Charles Lamb,
thought that the subject deserved an essay.</p>

<p>In speaking of the ornaments on the tea-cup he says, in "Old China":</p>

<p>"I like to see my old friends, whom distance cannot diminish, figuring up in
the air (so they appear to our optics), yet on terra firma still, for so we must
in courtesy interpret that speck of deeper blue which the decorous artist, to
prevent absurdity, has made to spring up beneath their sandals. I love the men
with women's faces and the women, if possible, with still more womanish
expressions.</p>

<p>"Here is a young and courtly Mandarin, handing tea to a lady from a
salver--two miles off. See how distance seems to set off respect! And here the
same lady, or another--for likeness is identity on tea-cups--is stepping into a
little fairy boat, moored on the hither side of this calm garden river, with a
dainty, mincing foot, which is in a right angle of incidence (as angles go in
our world) that must infallibly land her in the midst of a flowery mead--a
furlong off on the other side of the same strange stream!"</p>

<p>The <i>Spectator</i> and the <i>Tatter</i> were also susceptible to the
female influence that tea inspired. In both of these journals there are frequent allusions to tea-parties and china. At
these gatherings, poets and dilletante literary gentlemen read their verses and
essays to the ladies, who criticised their merits. These "literary teas"
became so contagious that a burning desire for authorship took possession of the
ladies, for among those who made their debut as authors about this time were
Fanny Burney, Mrs. Alphra Behn, Mrs. Manley, the Countess of Winchelsea, and a
host of others.</p>

<p>One of the readers of the <i>Spectator</i> wrote as follows:</p>

<p>"<i>Mr. Spectator:</i> Your paper is a part of my tea-equipage, and my
servant knows my humor so well that, calling for my breakfast this morning (it
being past my usual hour), she answered, the <i>Spectator</i> was not come in, but that the tea-kettle
boiled, and she expected it every minute."</p>

<p>Crabbe, too, was a devotee of ladies, literature, and tea, for he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The gentle fair on nervous tea relies,<br>
Whilst gay good-nature sparkles in her eyes;<br>
And inoffensive scandal fluttering round,<br>
Too rough to tickle and too light to wound."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What better proof do we want, therefore, that to women's influence is due the
cultivation and retention of the tea habit? Without tea, what would become of
women, and without women and tea, what would become of our domestic literary men
and matinee idols? They would not sit at home or in salons and write and act
things. There would be no homes to sit in, no salons or theatres to act in,
and dramatic art would receive a blow from which it could not
recover in a century, at least.</p>

<p>In the year 1700, J. Roberts, a London publisher, issued a pamphlet of about
fifty pages which was made up as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Poem upon Tea in Two Cantos . . . 34 pages<br>
Dedication of the poem . . . . . . . . . . 6&nbsp; &quot;<br>
Preface to the poem . . . . . . . . . . . .&nbsp; 2&nbsp; &quot;<br>

Tea-Table . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2&nbsp; &quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The poem--<i>pièce de résistance</i>--which is by one Nahum Tate, who
figures on the title-page as "Servant to His Majesty," is an allegory; and
although good in spots is too long and too dry to reproduce here. "The poem
upon the poem," "The Introduction," and the "Tea-Table" verses will be found
interesting and entertaining.</p>

On soaring Wings of Contemplation rise,<br>
And fetch Discov'ries from above the Skies;<br>
Ethereal TEA your Notions will resine,<br>
Till you yourselves become almost Divine.</p>

<p>You statesmen, who in Storms the Publick<br>
Helm Wou'd Guide with Skill, and Save a sinking Realm,<br>
TEA, your Minerva, shall suggest such Sense,<br>
Such safe and sudden Turns of Thought dispense,<br>
That you, like her Ulysses, may Advise,<br>
And start Designs that shall the World surprise.</p>

<p>You Pleaders, who for Conquest at the Bar<br>
Contend as Fierce and Loud as Chiefs in War;<br>
Would you Amaze and Charm the list'ning Court?<br>
First to this Spring of Eloquence resort:<br>
Then boldly launch on Tully's flowing Seas,<br>
And grasp the Thunder of Demosthenes.

<p>You Artists of the AEsculapian Tribe,<br>
Wou'd you, like AEsculapius's Self, Prescribe,<br>
Cure Maladies, and Maladies prevent?<br>
Receive this Plant, from your own Phoebus sent;<br>
Whence Life's nice Lamp in Temper is maintain'd,<br>
When Dim, Recruited, when too fierce, restrained.</p>

<p>You Curious Souls, who all our Thoughts apply,<br>
The hidden Works of Nature to descry;<br>
Why veering Winds with Vari'd Motion blow,<br>
Why Seas in settled Courses Ebb and Flow;<br>
Wou'd you these Secrets of her Empire know?<br>
Treat the Coy Nymph with this Celestial Dew,<br>
Like Ariadne she'll impart the Clue;<br>
Shall through her Winding Labyrinths convey,<br>
And Causes, iculking in their Cells, display.</p>

<p>You that to Isis's Bark or Cam retreat,<br>
Wou'd you prove worthy Sons of either Seat,<br>
And All in Learning's Commonwealth be Great?<br>
Infuse this Leaf, and your own Streams shall bring<br>
More Science than the fam'd Castalian Spring.</p>

Rouse Rev'ling Monarchs into Martial Rage,<br>
And, when Inflam'd, with Softer Notes As swage;<br>
The tedious Hours of absent Love beguile,<br>
Charm Care asleep, and make Affliction smile?<br>
Carouse in Tea, that will your Souls inspire;<br>
Drink Phoebus's liquor and command his Lyre.</p>

<p>Sons of Appelles, wou'd you draw the Face<br>
And Shape of Venus, and with equal
Grace <br>
In some Elysian Field the Figure place?<br>
Your Fancy, warm'd by TEA, with wish'd success,<br>
Shall Beauty's Queen in all her Charms express;<br>
With Nature's Rural Pride your Landscape fill<br>
The Shady Grotto, and the Sunny Hill,<br>
The Laughing Meadow, and the Talking Rill.</p>

<p>Sons of the Muses, would you Charm the Plains<br>
With Chearful Lays, or Sweet Condoling Strains;<br>
Or with a Sonnet make the Vallies ring,<br>
To Welcome home the Goddess of the Spring?<br>
Or wou'd you in sublimer Themes engage,<br>
And sing of Worthies who adorn the Age?<br>
Or, with Promethean Boldness, wou'd aspire<br>
To Catch a Spark of the Celestial Fire<br>
That Crowned the Royal Conquest, and could raise<br>
Juverne's Boyn above Scamander's Praise?<br>
Drink, drink Inspiring TEA, and boldly draw<br>
A Hercules, a Mars, or a NASSAU.</p>

Thou Won'drous Panacea to asswage<br>
The Calentures of Youths' fermenting rage,<br>
And Animate the freezing Veins of age.</p>

<p>To Bacchus when our Griefs repair for Ease,<br>
The Remedy proves worse than the Disease.<br>
Where Reason we must lose to keep the Round,<br>
And drinking others Health's, our own confound:<br>
Whilst TEA, our Sorrows to beguile,<br>
Sobriety and Mirth does reconcile:<br>
For to this Nectar we the Blessing owe,<br>
To grow more Wise, as we more Cheerful grow.</p>

<p>Whilst fancy does her brightest beams dispense,<br>
And decent Wit diverts without Offense.<br>
Then in Discourse of Nature's mystick Pow'rs<br>
And Noblest Themes, we pass the well spent Hours.<br>
Whilst all around the Virtues' Sacred Band,<br>
And list'ning Graces, pleas'd Attendants, stand.</p>

<p>Thus our Tea-Conversation we employ,<br>
Where with Delight, Instruction we enjoy;<br>
Quaffing, without the waste of Time or Wealth,<br>
The Sov'reign Drink of Pleasure and of Health.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>DR. JOHNSON'S AFFINITY</i></p>

<p>DR. SAMUEL JOHNSON drew his own portrait thus:</p>

<p>"A hardened and shameless tea-drinker, who for twenty years diluted his meals
with the infusion of this fascinating plant; whose kettle had scarcely time to
cool; who with tea amused the evening, with tea solaced the midnight, and with
tea welcomed the morning."</p>
</blockquote>

<br>

<p><i>EARLIEST MENTION OF TEA</i></p>

<p>According to a magazinist, the first mention of tea by an Englishman is to be
found in a letter from Mr. Wickham, an agent of the East India Company, written
from Japan, on the 27th of June, 1615, to Mr. Eaton, another officer of the
company, a resident of Macao, asking him to send "a pot of the best chaw." In
Mr. Eaton's accounts of expenditure occurs this item:</p>

<p>"Three silver porringiys to drink chaw in."</p>


<br>

<p><i>AUSTRALIAN TEA</i></p>

<p>In the interior of Australia all the men drink tea. They drink it all day
long, and in quantities and at a strength that would seem to be poisonous. On
Sunday morning the tea-maker starts with a clean pot and a clean record. The pot
is hung over the fire with a sufficiency of water in it for the day's brew, and
when this has boiled he pours into it enough of the fragrant herb to produce a
deep, coffee-colored liquid.</p>

<p>On Monday, without removing yesterday's tea-leaves, he repeats the process;
on Tuesday da capo and on Wednesday da capo, and so on through the week. Toward
the close of it the great pot is filled with an acrid mash of tea-leaves, out of which
the liquor is squeezed by the pressure of a tin cup.</p>

<p>By this time the tea is of the color of rusty iron, incredibly bitter and
disagreeable to the uneducated palate. The native calls it "real good old post
and rails," the simile being obviously drawn from a stiff and dangerous jump,
and regards it as having been brought to perfection.</p>

<br>


<p><i>FIVE-O'CLOCK TEA</i></p>

<p>There is a fallacy among certain tea-fanciers that the origin of five-o'clock
tea was due to hygienic demand. These students of the stomach contend that as a
tonic and gentle stimulant, when not taken with meat, it is not to be equalled.
With meat or any but light food it is considered harmful. Taken between luncheon
and dinner it drives away fatigue and acts as a tonic. This is good if true, but
it is only a theory, after all. Our theory is that five o'clock in the afternoon
is the ladies' leisure hour, and that the taking of tea at that time is an
escape from <i>ennui</i>.</p>

<br>

<p><i>TEA IN LADIES' NOVELS</i></p>

<p>What would women novelists do without tea in their books? The novelists of
the rougher sex write of "over the coffee and cigars"; or, "around the gay
and festive board"; or, "over a bottle of old port"; or, "another bottle of dry
and sparkling champagne was cracked"; or, "and the succulent welsh rarebits were
washed down with royal mugs of musty ale"; or, "as the storm grew fiercer, the
captain ordered all hands to splice the main brace," <i>i. e.</i>, to take
a drink of rum; or, "as he gulped down the last drink of fiery whiskey, he
reeled through the tavern door, and his swaying form drifted into the
bleak, black night, as a roar of laughter drowned his repentant
sobs." But the ladies of the novel confine themselves almost exclusively to
tea--rarely allowing their heroes and heroines to indulge in even coffee, though
they sometimes treat their heroes to wine; but their heroines rarely get
anything from them but Oolong.</p>

<br>
<p><i>SYDNEY SMITH</i></p>

<p>One evening when Sidney Smith was drinking tea with Mrs. Austin the servant
entered the crowded room with a boiling tea-kettle in his hand. It seemed
doubtful, nay, impossible, he should make his way among the numerous gossips--but
on the first approach of the steaming kettle the crowd receded on all sides, Mr.
Smith among the rest, though carefully watching the progress of the lad to the
table.</p>

<p>"I declare," said he, addressing Mrs. Austin, "a man who wishes to make his
way in life could do no better than go through the world with a boiling
tea-kettle in his hand."--<i>Life of Rev. Sydney Smith</i>.</p>

<br>

<p><i>DR. JOHNSON AGAIN</i></p>

<p>The good doctor evidently lived up to his reputation as a tea-drinker at all
times and places. Cumberland, the dramatist, in his memoirs gives a story
illustrative of the doctor's tea-drinking powers: "I remember when Sir Joshua
Reynolds, at my home, reminded Dr. Johnson that he had drunk eleven cups of tea.
'Sir,' he replied, 'I did not count your glasses of wine; why should
you number my cups of tea?'"</p>

<p>At another time a certain Lady Macleod, after pouring out sixteen cups for
him, ventured mildly to ask whether a basin would not save him trouble and be more convenient. "I
wonder, madam," he replied, roughly, "why all ladies ask such questions?" "It is
to save yourself trouble, not me," was the tactful answer of his hostess.</p>


<br>

<blockquote>
<p><i>A CUP OF TEA</i></p>
<p><i>From St. Nicholas, December, 1899</i>.</p>

<p>Now Grietje from her window sees the leafless poplars lean<br>
Against a windy sunset sky with streaks of golden green;<br>
The still canal is touched with light from that wild, wintry sky,<br>
And, dark and gaunt, the windmill flings its bony arms on high.<br>
"It's growing late; it's growing cold; I'm all alone," says she;<br>
"I'll put the little kettle on, to make a cup of tea!"</p>

<p>Mild radiance from the porcelain stove reflects on shining tiles;<br>
The kettle beams, so red and bright that Grietje thinks it smiles;<br>
The kettle sings--so soft and low it seems as in a dream--<br>
The song that's like a lullaby, the pleasant song of steam:<br>
"The summer's gone; the storks are flown; I'm always here, you see,<br>
To sing and sing, and shine, and shine, and make a cup of tea!"</p>

<p>The blue delft plates and dishes gleam, all ranged upon the shelf;<br>
The tall Dutch clock tick-ticks away, just talking to itself;<br>
The brindled pussy cuddles down, and basks and blinks and purrs;<br>
And rosy, sleepy Grietje droops that snow-white cap of hers.<br>
"I do like winter after all; I'm very glad," says she,<br>
"I put--my--little--kettle--on--to make--a cup--of--tea!"<br>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
